You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  I've learned how to using HTML hypertext markup language to struct a web page and to achieve different display
  format(fonts, margin, line). I have also learned how to be a developer by implementing some very good methods
  I've learned in udacity courses so far.

  * What has been easy?
  I think the syntax of html is not hard, there is no too much complicated logic in it.

  * What has been difficult?
  I think design a user-friendly structure will be difficult, especially when it comes to responsive design.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  Using Google is always my best strategy to solve most of the problems. Another very important strategy is
  keep a good mindset, when I have a clear mindset, then my brain will sort out a solution for me to progress
  the challenge. I think coding is like painting, you can create your best work when you have a clear mind,
  a good mood and a good energy. I don't think it's a good environment when people under heavy pressure.
  The greatest art pieces are all come from the artist when they are really engaging the creation. When you have a
  clear goal, you shouldn't be worried the outcome, because you have already print out the outcome in your mind.
  Brendan Eich developed JS in 10 days is a perfect example about clear mindset leads to success.
